# iPhone ARKit #

## Overview ##

iPhone ARKit is a small set of class that can give you augmented reality in any iPhone application. The kind of augmented reality that ARKit caters to is overlay of information (usually geographic) over a camera view. The background camera view acts as a "window" onto the world around you.

iPhone ARKit's APIs are modeled after MapKit's. For an overview of MapKit, please read [the documentation](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MapKit_Framework_Reference/index.html) for more information.

While iPhone ARKit's API isn't an exact match, one controller can act as the delegate for both and serve up all location information. Please see the documentation in our [wiki](http://wiki.github.com/zac/iphonearkit) (forthcoming!).

## Current Status ##

iPhone ARKit is a slight bit rough right now. It is possible to find it useful, but it probably won't be a drop in addition to your project. To view or add to our bugs and feature requests, check out the [Issues](http://issues.github.com/zac/iphonearkit) section.
